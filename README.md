# Chocolatey Scripts
 Notes of useful chocolatey scripts


I made this script that runs the usual chocolatey update.  This also is for configuration of cleaning the desktop of newly-added shortcuts of programs that get updated for ones you want gone.  It cycles through the user desktop and then the Public Desktop.  I've used this in Task Scheduler run as the user (with highest privileges for Chocolatey).
